## Homework

In this homework, we'll take the ride duration prediction model
that we deployed in batch mode in homework 4 and improve the 
reliability of our code with unit and integration tests. 

## Q1. Refactoring


Now we need to create the "main" block from which we'll invoke
the main function. How does the `if` statement that we use for
this looks like? 

```python
if __name__ == "__main__":
```

## Q2. Installing pytest

Now we need to install `pytest`:

```bash
pipenv install --dev pytest
```

Next, create a folder `tests` and then two files inside. 

The first one will be the file with tests. We can name it `test_batch.py`. 

The second file will be `__init__.py`. So, why do we need this second file?

- To define a package and specify its boundaries
- To manage the import of modules from the package 
- Both of the above options are correct

## Q3. Writing first unit test

Now let's cover our code with unit tests.

We'll start with the pre-processing logic inside `read_data`.

It's difficult to test right now because first reads
the file and then performs some transformations. We need to split this 
code into two parts: reading (I/O) and transformation. 

So let's create a function `prepare_data` that takes in a dataframe 
(and some other parameters too) and applies some transformation to it.

(That's basically the entire `read_data` function after reading 
the parquet file)

Now create a test and use this as input:

```python
data = [
    (None, None, dt(1, 2), dt(1, 10)),
    (1, None, dt(1, 2), dt(1, 10)),
    (1, 2, dt(2, 2), dt(2, 3)),
    (None, 1, dt(1, 2, 0), dt(1, 2, 50)),
    (2, 3, dt(1, 2, 0), dt(1, 2, 59)),
    (3, 4, dt(1, 2, 0), dt(2, 2, 1)),     
]

columns = ['PULocationID', 'DOLocationID', 'tpep_pickup_datetime', 'tpep_dropoff_datetime']
df = pd.DataFrame(data, columns=columns)
```

Where `dt` is a helper function:

```python
from datetime import datetime

def dt(hour, minute, second=0):
    return datetime(2022, 1, 1, hour, minute, second)
```

How many rows should be there in the expected dataframe?

- 3

## Q4. Mocking S3 with Localstack 

Now let's prepare for an integration test. In our script, we 
write data to S3. So we'll use Localstack to mimic S3.

First, let's run Localstack with Docker compose. Let's create a 
`docker-compose.yaml` file with just one service: localstack. Inside
localstack, we're only interested in running S3. 

Start the service and test it by creating a bucket where we'll
keep the output. Let's call it "nyc-duration".

With AWS CLI, this is how we create a bucket:

```bash
aws s3 mb s3://nyc-duration
```

Then we need to check that the bucket was successfully created. With AWS, this is how we typically do it:

```bash
aws s3 ls
```

In both cases we should adjust commands for localstack. Which option do we need to use for such purposes?

- `--endpoint-url`

Let's modify our `read_data` function:

- check if `S3_ENDPOINT_URL` is set, and if it is, use it for reading
- otherwise use the usual way


## Q5. Creating test data

Now let's create `integration_test.py`

We'll use the dataframe we created in Q3 (the dataframe for the unit test)
and save it to S3. You don't need to do anything else: just create a dataframe 
and save it.

We will pretend that this is data for January 2022.

Run the `integration_test.py` script. After that, use AWS CLI to verify that the 
file was created. 

Use this snipped for saving the file:

```python
df_input.to_parquet(
    input_file,
    engine='pyarrow',
    compression=None,
    index=False,
    storage_options=options
)
```

What's the size of the file?

- 3667

## Q6. Finish the integration test

We can read from our localstack s3, but we also need to write to it.

Create a function `save_data` which works similarly to `read_data`,
but we use it for saving a dataframe. 

Let's run the `batch.py` script for "January 2022" (the fake data
we created in Q5). 

We can do that from our integration test in Python: we can use
`os.system` for doing that (there are other options too). 

Now it saves the result to localstack.

The only thing we need to do now is to read this data and 
verify the result is correct. 

What's the sum of predicted durations for the test dataframe?

```bash
‚ùØ python sum_pred_durations.py 2022 1
31.507450372727607
```

- 31.51
